        <h3 style="text-align: center;">We are so back as Vitalink becomes the richest man in Crypto space</h3>
        <h4 style="font-size: smaller;">August 5, 2025</h4>
        <p>A growing number of small, publicly traded companies are turning to Ether as a strategic inflation hedge—holding approximately 966,304 ETH (around $3.5 billion) in their treasuries, compared to under 116,000 ETH at the end of 2024. They're drawn to ETH for its growth potential and staking yields (3–4%), especially in decentralized finance (DeFi). Yet analysts caution that this surge may echo past speculative frenzies, with regulatory concerns and volatility still looming.</p>
